🏗️ Node.js Architecture Overview
Node.js follows an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, built on Google’s V8 engine and powered by libuv under the hood.

🔑 Key Characteristics:
Single-threaded (for JS execution)

Non-blocking & asynchronous

Event-driven

Uses a Thread Pool for handling heavy I/O tasks

🧠 Event-Driven Architecture in Node.js
In traditional web servers (like Apache), each client request creates a new thread. But in Node.js:

There’s a single main thread

Incoming requests/events are handled using callbacks or events

No new threads are created per request (unless needed for I/O)

🧲 How it works:
A client sends a request.

Node registers the request as an event.

Instead of blocking the thread, it assigns the task to the event loop.

When the task (like file read or DB fetch) finishes, it emits an event, and the callback is executed.

🔁 What is the Event Loop?
The event loop is the core of Node.js's non-blocking architecture.
It constantly listens for new tasks, executes them, and responds when asynchronous operations are completed.

💡 Key Point:
Node.js may be single-threaded, but the event loop allows it to handle many connections at once.


🧵 What is a Thread?
A thread is the smallest unit of a process that can be scheduled to run.
You can think of a thread like a line of execution in a program.

🔹 Single Thread
Only one line of execution at a time.

Tasks are performed sequentially.

If one task takes time (e.g., reading a file or waiting for an API), it blocks the execution of the next one.

📌 Example:
js
Copy
Edit
console.log('Start');
readFile(); // Takes 3 seconds
console.log('End'); // Will wait for readFile to finish
✅ Advantages:
Simple and easy to manage

No risk of thread conflicts or race conditions

❌ Disadvantages:
Slower when handling multiple tasks

Can become unresponsive if a task is blocking

🔸 Multi Thread
Multiple threads run simultaneously.

Tasks can be executed in parallel, speeding up performance.

Common in languages like Java, C++, and Python (with multiprocessing/threading).

📌 Example:
Think of downloading a file, resizing an image, and processing user input all at once — in different threads.

✅ Advantages:
Can perform multiple tasks concurrently

Better for CPU-intensive operations (e.g., image processing, calculations)

❌ Disadvantages:
Harder to manage (thread synchronization, race conditions)

More resource-heavy

Bugs are harder to trace

🟢 Node.js: A Special Case
Node.js is single-threaded for JavaScript code, but it uses multi-threading under the hood for I/O operations through libuv.

So it's like:

"Single-threaded for writing code, but smart enough to handle multiple things in the background."
