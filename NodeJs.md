🟢 What is Node.js?
Node.js is a runtime environment that lets you run JavaScript code outside the browser, typically on the server.

Instead of using JavaScript just for the frontend (in browsers), Node.js allows developers to write backend/server-side applications using JavaScript.

🕰️ History of Node.js
Created by: Ryan Dahl

First released: 2009

Motivation: Ryan Dahl was frustrated with the limited concurrency in web servers like Apache and wanted a non-blocking, event-driven solution.

Before Node.js, JavaScript was mainly limited to the browser. Node opened the door for full-stack JavaScript development.

🤔 Why Node.js is Used
Runs JavaScript on the server.

Handles multiple client requests efficiently using non-blocking I/O.

Great for real-time applications (like chat apps or live notifications).

Ideal for APIs, microservices, and single-page applications (SPAs).

Uses npm (Node Package Manager) — the largest ecosystem of open-source libraries.
