üß© What is a Module?
A module in Node.js is a separate file or piece of code that can be reused in other parts of your application.

üì¶ Think of it like:
Lego blocks ‚Äì small, reusable, and each has a specific function. You can combine them to build something big and complex.

üß† Why Use Modules?
üîÅ Reusability ‚Äì Write once, use many times.

üßπ Clean Code ‚Äì Keeps codebase organized.

üîí Encapsulation ‚Äì Each module has its own scope.

üß™ Testability ‚Äì Easier to test smaller pieces of code.

üîπ Types of Modules in Node.js
1. Built-in Modules
Provided by Node.js out of the box.
Examples: fs, http, path, os, events

js
Copy
Edit
const fs = require('fs');
fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => {
  console.log(data.toString());
});
2. User-defined Modules
Your own custom code organized into files.

math.js

js
Copy
Edit
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
module.exports = add;
main.js

js
Copy
Edit
const add = require('./math');
console.log(add(5, 3)); // 8
3. Third-party Modules
Installed via npm (Node Package Manager).

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install express
js
Copy
Edit
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
üß∞ How Modules Work Internally
Each module in Node.js is wrapped like this:

js
Copy
Edit
(function(exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
  // your module code here
});
So each module has its own:

exports ‚Äì To export functions/variables

require ‚Äì To import other modules

__filename ‚Äì File path of the module

__dirname ‚Äì Directory path

üõ†Ô∏è Exporting in Modules
‚úÖ Export a single function or object
js
Copy
Edit
module.exports = function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
}
‚úÖ Export multiple values
js
Copy
Edit
exports.add = (a, b) => a + b;
exports.sub = (a, b) => a - b;
üßæ Summary
Node.js modules help split code into small, manageable files.

Three types: built-in, custom/user-defined, and npm/third-party.

Use require() to import and module.exports or exports to export.

Encourages clean architecture and code reuse.


üè° What is a Local Module?
A local module is a custom module that you create in your Node.js project. It‚Äôs a separate .js file (or multiple files) that contains reusable logic, which can be imported and used elsewhere in your project.

You use local modules to break your app into smaller pieces, like handling math, authentication, logging, database logic, etc.

‚úÖ Why Use Local Modules?
Keep code organized and clean

Make logic reusable

Improve maintainability

Easier to test and debug



üßæ Summary
A local module is any .js file you create in your project.

Use module.exports to expose values/functions.

Use require('./moduleName') to import it.

Helps organize code and promote reusability.
