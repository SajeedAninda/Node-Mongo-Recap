1. Basic Concept: Client and Server
Client: The device or application (like a browser â€“ Chrome, Firefox) that requests web content.
ðŸ‘‰ Example: You type www.google.com in Chrome.

Server: A computer that stores web content (like websites, images, code) and sends it back to clients when requested.
ðŸ‘‰ Googleâ€™s servers send you the homepage when you request it.


2. Domain Name & IP Address
IP Address: Every server on the internet has a unique numerical address, like 142.250.190.78 (Google's IP).
It's how devices find each other on the internet.

Domain Name: Easy-to-remember names (like google.com) used instead of IPs.
ðŸ‘‰ It's hard to remember numbers, so we use names.

DNS (Domain Name System): Works like a phonebook. It translates domain names to IP addresses.

ðŸ“ž Example Flow:
You type google.com (client).

DNS converts it to 142.250.190.78 (IP).

Now your browser knows where to send the request.

3. HTTP: The Communication Protocol
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Itâ€™s the set of rules for transferring data on the web.

When your browser talks to a server, it uses HTTP requests like:

GET (get data)

POST (send data)

PUT, DELETE, etc.

4. Full Flow: How It All Works Together
Imagine you open your browser and go to www.google.com:
Client (your browser) checks if it knows the IP of www.google.com.

If not, it asks a DNS server to resolve the domain to an IP.

DNS replies: "It's 142.250.190.78".

Browser sends an HTTP request to that IP (the server).

Server processes the request and responds with a web page (HTML).

Browser renders that web page for you to see.
