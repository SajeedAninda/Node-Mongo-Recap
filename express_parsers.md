üß† Different Types of Parsers in Express.js
In Express, parsers are used to handle and extract data from incoming HTTP request bodies.
This makes it easier to work with req.body.

1Ô∏è‚É£ express.json()
Parses JSON data from the request body.

Used when you send data as Content-Type: application/json.

app.use(express.json());


2Ô∏è‚É£ express.urlencoded()
Parses data from HTML form submissions.

Used for application/x-www-form-urlencoded content-type (default from HTML <form>).

app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));



3Ô∏è‚É£ express.raw()
Parses raw binary data.

Used when you want the request body as a Buffer without any parsing.

app.use(express.raw());
‚úÖ Use case:
File uploads or handling non-standard binary formats.

4Ô∏è‚É£ express.text()
Parses incoming requests with text/plain content type.
